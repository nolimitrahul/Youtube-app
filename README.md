# Youtube-app
Create a Youtube app on Xcode using SwiftUI, the videos look similar  to the actual app. With youtube channel icon, upload date and view count under the video name. When you click on the video it takes you to another page and shows you the video description and a watch now button which takes you to youtube to watch the video. Photos of the app are in the "app photos" folder.
